    <p>I wonder if you remember</p>
    <p>our parting hug at the airport</p> 
    <p>from all those years ago</p> 
    <p>when I first left,</p> 
    <p>before we both knew what it meant.</p> 
    <p> </p>
    <p>I have almost forgotten it. </p>
    <p>I have almost forgotten </p>
    <p>those school day mornings </p>
    <p>when I would wake up </p>
    <p>to the soft brushing of straws, </p>
    <p>when you were sweeping </p>
    <p>the leaves and fallen starfruit. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>And afterwards, we’d bike </p>
    <p>to that busy street market </p>
    <p>just past the busy intersection </p>
    <p>and wait for the banh mi cart. </p>
    <p>We’d get one for you </p>
    <p>and one for my brother </p>
    <p>and two more for me, </p>
    <p>because I was the youngest </p>
    <p>and I loved sweet pork floss </p>
    <p>salty, savory pâté mayonnaise </p>
    <p>and assortment of tender ham. </p>
    <p>All four for two dollars </p>
    <p>out of your retirement pay. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>I hope you remember </p>
    <p>last summer when I was back </p>
    <p>when we would sit together, </p>
    <p>lounging on your leather sofa. </p>
    <p>You would read the daily paper </p>
    <p>and I would read the news on my phone. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>And, we prayed together </p>
    <p>to my great-grandparents. </p>
    <p>and you would ask them </p>
    <p>to bless me good fortune. </p>
    <p>Three times we bowed </p>
    <p>and three fragrant incenses we burned </p>
    <p>for each blessing. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>And at sunrise, we biked again </p>
    <p>to that familiar pho restaurant, </p>
    <p>whose jovial owner still remembered us </p>
    <p>from all those years ago. </p>
    <p>He gave us our usual discounts, </p>
    <p>saying: How your boys have grown! </p>
    <p>I remember when they were yay high. </p>
    <p>We’d get one bowl for you </p>
    <p>and one bowl for my brother </p>
    <p>and two more bowls for me, </p>
    <p>because I was the hungriest. </p>
    <p>All four for ten dollars </p>
    <p>out of my student wages. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>I hope you forgive me </p>
    <p>for all those months </p>
    <p>when I had rarely called, </p>
    <p>for all those holidays </p>
    <p>that I had missed, away, </p>
    <p>for all those times I was home </p>
    <p>with a lump in my mother tongue. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>I’ll come home soon </p>
    <p>and make it up to you. </p>
    <p>And maybe someday </p>
    <p>many years later </p>
    <p>I’ll get you those </p>
    <p>fragrant oud incense </p>
    <p>and two banh mi’s </p>
    <p>and two bowls of pho. </p>
