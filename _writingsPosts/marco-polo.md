    You were born in a quaint village near the Palace of Versailles. Your father sold souvenirs there and your mother was a maid in a Chateau at a Cabernet-Sauvignon vineyard. In the summers, you’d get to shadow your father in Versaille. He sold souvenirs of every kind: miniature plastic Eiffel Towers and Arc de Triomphes, rubber keychains of baguettes and berets, fridge magnets of art from Monet, Gauguin and Magritte, and even Matryoshka dolls of French leaders, Napoleon to de Gaulle, which he imported from some wood shop in St. Petersburg, Russia. Instead of playing war as the Resistance around the drystone walls of your village, you were prowling the gates of Versailles with other souvenir shop kids: Petit Quasi (affectionately nicknamed for his hunchback) and Julien. Your daily shenanigans included pickpocketing, misdirecting lovebirds from photo-ops, and disrupting tours. When the guards finally caught you, you’d be sent back to your stall, where your disappointed father punished you with reading Napoleon’s biography:
  </p>



  
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">“Napoleon was born in 1769 on an island named Corsica.”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">“Correct.”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">“He died in 18… umm… 1821?”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">“Good, and where did he die?”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">“On an island named St. Helena. Also, papa! Papa! He said, ‘A man’s greatness is measured from his head to the sky.’”
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">Your father was short, so he liked that.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    By your twelfth summer, you were a bookworm and had mastered French history, from Caesar’s conquest of Gaul, to La Montagne, Girondin, and the Triple Entente. You were also alone by then as Julien’s stall went out of business, and Petit Quasi’s decided to risk it all by moving to the Eiffel Tower. Your father had a big argument with Petit Quasi’s mother about that decision. Struggling in Versailles’ competitive souvenir market himself, your father’s complaints often reached you. 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Why don’t we move to Paris too?”, you suggested.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt; text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
    To that he replied, “You already know what I think about that. Why don’t you do some research, son?” </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    So, you did. You started with Rosseau, Smith, then Weber, Sen, and ended with Marx. Somewhere along the way, the answer to your dad’s question appeared plainly: he lacked superior entrepreneurial skill. There was still more to learn though: the principal-agent problem, asymmetric information, Nash equilibria, et cetera. To support your inquiries, you took up a job tending vineyards up at your mother’s place. You also work-travelled from time to time during your secondary education to save up for university. Once, you bussed tables down in Monaco just to see a Japanese footbridge like the one in a Monet painting you liked. The next year you served beer at a train station in Zaragoza where the hills were like white elephants.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    In the end, your dedication paid off and landed you a spot at La Sorbonne, the best in France, where you would major in Economics. At school, you spent extra hours researching for your own theory and talking with professors until your ears wore off. You also hustled outside of school selling replicas of Monets outside the Louvre, using your economic knowledge to cycle between him, Van Gogh, and Cezanne to continually appeal to the market’s capricious taste for artists. You were thriving; you had even found the love of your life through an Intro to Poetry class. You wooed her by reciting her favourite poem, T. S. Eliot’s <i>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, </i>verbatim. You were her Prufrock, her Prince Hamlet. 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    Unfortunately, your hot streak hit a cold front in your junior year. You had to close shop and incurred debt as a new buzz for irreplicable Basquiats and Jackson Pollocks decreased the demand for your evocative replicas. The nature of their art meant a shift towards exact reprints, but you couldn’t compete in an industry where <i>Benoit and Co. </i>owned 80% of the market share with their control of the printers. Economic research was also becoming more constrained to late-stage capitalist models of mass consumption. Your ideas for your magnum opus, <i>La Théorie de l'Économie du Croissant, </i>were constantly struck down by professors due to welfare advocacy and dismantling of greed. Your girlfriend also left you for a hotshot actor who recently won the Palme d’Or. That hurt you badly. By the end of that year, you still hadn’t move on from her. Every night, you tossed and turned, haunted by memories of the cozy nights you spent reading books together, the dinners she cooked for you, her lovely smile, her doting eyes and her cheerful spirit. Depressed, you fell into a bad bout of partying and gambling, which left you with a lot of must-pay short-term loans. You also dropped out after getting into an argument with your thesis advisor and flunking your exams. 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
    You busted tables again to repay your debts, this time on the rocky beaches of Nice. After a year, you made a last-ditch effort to restart your life by taking an offer to lecture Economics and teach French in Haiti. First, you took the Transatlantic Concorde to Miami. Then, while on a seaplane to Port-au-Prince, your plane crashed into the dark ocean somewhere within the Bermuda Triangle. After drinking copious amounts of seawater and luckily being saved by an apparently nocturnal dolphin, you washed up on a small French Caribbean Island inhabited by a small fishing community. They took you in, gave you new clothes and fed you. They spoke basic French so language wasn’t a problem. 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    Taking it as a sign from God to take a break from Western life, you started helping out around the island. In the morning, you washed clothes with the women and went on runs along the sunny beach, letting your bare feet splash in the clear, turquoise water. Afterwards, you played soccer with the children, standing in goal with your tall frame and letting them hysterically smash shots at you. At lunch time, you manned the grill, serving up a selection of fish caught yesterday. By night, you did financial accounting for the village and consulted the elders on economic decisions moving forward. Also, every night, at the village’s musical gathering near the beach, you were never afraid to bust a dance move under the influence of coconut rum. Your hips never lie. 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
    Within a few years, you had largely forgotten about life back home except for a couple of letters you sent to your parents—you were assumed dead following the crash—and the island had become one of the wealthiest in French Caribe. The villagers were able to set up a free health clinic using only ten percent of the island’s profits. A secondary economy was also created on the island which manufactured goods using raw materials from neighbouring islands and sent them back for a small fee—the elders agree that there shouldn’t be exacerbated profits. You also trained a group of talented boys and girls in accounting and consulting so that such services would spread throughout the region. Against your parents’ request for you to come home, you left to go on some island-hopping adventures using a boat gifted to you by the villagers.  
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
    In the Bahamas, you partied and gambled like an animal with what was left of your French bank account. There, you tried to entertain love again, but quickly realised that no one could ever replace her. Dejected, you smoked reefers with the Rastafarians in Kingston and even sang Three Little Birds with Bob Marley on the record. Then, you drank milkshakes and smoked Havana’s finest cigars as a trusted comrade of Fidel Castro when he enlisted your help on implementing a system of free healthcare in Cuba. Near the end of your stay, you brokered a deal for the return of Guantanamo Bay to Cuban control. For a year, you partnered with MLB scouts to set up a baseball camp in Santo Domingo, which has produced twenty first-round draft picks since you left. Next, you found Ponce de Leon’s Fountain of Youth in a small sunlit clearing surrounded by blooming magnolia trees somewhere upstream from the azure estuaries of Martinique. That day, there was a slight breeze that blew the pink petals gently down onto the water surface, and the suspiciously young shaman, reading that as an omen, decided to gift you a vial of elixir: 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Please take this with you.”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“It’s OK… I don’t think I will use it.” You hesitantly declined.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“The trees insist. I can sense it. So, please take it.”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
    After your Caribbean exploits, you went global. You spent a year surveying the number of endangered Black Rhinos in the hot savannas of South Africa, and another year cross-country skiing in Siberia, looking for remnants of woolly mammoths in the white expanses near the pristine waters of Lake Baikal. You then spent a season up in the Mongolian steppe setting up yurts and herding yaks in the rolling grasslands under an infinite blue sky. After that, you traded saffron, agarwood and frankincense along the Silk Road, hiking village to village from the Tibetan foothills up to the vermillion walls and golden roofs of the Buddhist Potala Palace. There, you decided to give up all your Earthly possessions—the elixir as well—in pursuit of Nirvana under the tutelage of the 13<span class="s2">th </span>Dalai Lama. For two summers you sat under a tree to first become one with your own body, taking in the crisp highland air through your sinuses, exhaling steamy breath from your mouth, and listening to giant golden prayer bells chime with your ears. One day, you were visited by a Bodhisattva while meditating at your grove: 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“You are progressing nicely along the Eight Fold Path.”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Thank you, Avalokitesvara.”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“But, I sense that you’re having trouble with attaining Right Mindfulness?”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">“Yes. I can’t let go of the past yet for some reason. And all this time that I’ve been exploring the world and feeling free, I’ve been feeling lonely as well…”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“You don’t have to stay here. You can always come back when you’re ready.”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“I’ll give it one last go, Avalokitesvara.”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“No rush, child. No one’s path is ever straightforward.”</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    After subsequently failing to let go of all Earthly desires on the path to enlightenment—you still loved her—you returned to the Silk Road, drank mad honey at Everest base camp, and traversed the Karakoram Pass. While visiting Tashkent, you also met a certain Kublai Khan and joined his entourage, drinking green tea and describing to him all the cities which you had visited: cities unfathomable to him. After that, you listened to sixty out of one thousand and one stories from Scheherazade, retrieved an oil lamp for a young prince, sold magic rugs in Tehran’s black market, aided Lawrence of Arabia at the battle of Tafilah, transcribed the Dead Sea Scrolls, excavated the ancient city of Troy, and answered endless questions from Socrates in a debate surrounding Aristotle’s <i>Nicomachean Ethics.</i>
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    On one particularly beautiful moonlit night, you visited the Great Pyramids and witnessed a young shepherd getting mugged by a band of war refugees. After flying the boy back to Andalusia, you took the opportunity to scale the rock of Gibraltar and tend to the lush gardens of Alhambra. You travelled up the coast of Spain, ate Jamón Ibérico sandwiches and steak drowned in chimichurri on the cobbled streets of Valencia, and polished a spire of Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. There, the hills were like white elephants again, and for the first time in a while you reminisced about your childhood. You decided to finally go home.  
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    It has been fifteen years since the plane crash and you look different now: your hair textured with sea salt, your complexion tanned by the Caribbean sun, your limbs strengthened by the saffron trade, and you’re manlier, more mature. Returning to your home near Versailles, you cry for a whole night in your parents’ arms. The following week you spend retracing your childhood. You skim all your French history books, rearrange the Monet fridge magnets you’d taken from father’s stall, and recall your travels to Zaragoza and Monaco through film photographs you’d taken. Walking around your quaint village, you ran your fingers along those same stone walls you had died next to, feeling the constantly changing moss still clinging onto those ancient remnants. A road away from these walls, you find the prickly hedge where you once hid from the enemies for an entire night and returned home in the morning to your worried-sick mother’s delicious ratatouille.  
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    Visiting Paris, you meet Petit Quasi again. He is no longer petit, and he has helped his mother’s small stall turn into a monopoly on Parisian souvenir shops. As a gesture of your old friendship, he takes you to a nice restaurant. After dinner, he says,
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    “You are the smartest kid I know and I’m proud of you, mon ami.” 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    “Thanks Quasi. I’m proud of you too.”
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    “By the way, I knew you’d survive when I heard the news. Just like how you’d never lose to our dares back in Versailles.”
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    “Oui, oui. Those were the good old days, weren’t they?”
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    “They were the very best mon ami.”
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    Afterwards, while walking home, you see her on the street, still as beautiful as the day she left you. The memories of loving her tugged you like gravity as you walk past her. The penitent pang in your chest compels you to whisper her favourite poem: 
  </p>
  <p class="s1" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    <i>“Let us go then, you and I,</i>
  </p>
  <p class="s1" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
    <i>When the evening is spread out against the sky”</i>
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
    She looks back, and what used to be doting eyes now meet yours with a polite glance. The you she loved was lost long ago in some tropical ocean, her little Prufrock, scuttling across the floors of silent seas like a pair of ragged claws. For a temporary moment, the life you lost flashes before your eyes. You see children playing around drystone walls and a student going to lectures. You see editions of <i>La Théorie de l'Économie du Croissant</i> displayed in a bookstore. You see a warm hand holding your own, adorned with a diamond ring, and happy grandparents reading a bedtime story to curious grandchildren. Could you wind back the clock? Travel back to Martinique where the Fountain’s sweet elixir can give you a second chance? Could you relive it all? Maybe get it right this time? It's too late now. There’s nothing you can do, and she walks on. The night is young, you buy a train ticket up to Amsterdam.  
  </p>
