    Back in sixth grade, you had a crush on this girl named Hannah and since this was prior to your discovery of minimum critical thinking, your untrained instincts drove you towards a dire need to grab her attention. The problem is, you still haven’t hit your growth spurt yet at fourteen years old, and it was obvious that the height difference intimidated you. Not to mention that she liked a certain chap named Jack, who was on the soccer team with you, and who she would always show up to watch and cheer for. And for every other young haughty boy who were in the same cleat for just a second, it was pretty clear that you were destined to outshine Jack enough to tilt the scale in your favour.  
  </p>




  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
  Trouble is, you played goalie, and Jack played striker. And unfortunately, as a goalkeeper, when you make an important save, nobody cares, but when you let a single goal, everybody looks at you like some pitiful creature who had just let his whole team down. The striker, at least at the eighth-grade level, had the opposite of that problem. So, while you were out there putting your fragile body on the line for the team, diving left and right, covering up for your absolute travesty of a backline—really lovely fellows but their hearts weren’t in it—Jack was lounging up front, missing easy shots, scoring his only goal from point blank, and celebrating with a silly dance. It also didn’t help that the other striker, Little Luke—again, a very nice chap—made Jack look even more like a knight in shining armour with his lacklustre abilities. And similar to how you carry the defence on your humble back, your actually excellent midfield made up for the missing firepower so Little Luke and Jack could continue with their habitual misgivings.

  You needed to play up there, but therein lies another crack in the road. You weren’t the goalie because you good at it—you were anyways—you played there because they needed you to. You had already brought up the idea of playing at striker to coach after the second game of a ten-game season and had gotten the sincerest answer you’d ever hear from him: “We need you there. It’s not that I can’t find a replacement, you’re just most talented and selfless kid I’ve ever coached!” 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
  He sure knew how to motivate you, but little did he know, at this age, your selflessness had a limit. After the next game, you went looking for a replacement. All of the bench players rejected your offer, upon a perhaps telepathic understanding that there was no reward they want which you could give. However, that is except for one person, your own one-year younger brother who you knew had his own crush to impress. He was horrible: he couldn’t even get off the bench for defence so he probably can’t play goalie either? You didn’t bother telling him his impending predicament. Sometimes lies were necessary.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
  Training went smoothly enough. Your brother could save easy shots and to you that would suffice. Finally, in the seventh game, an unimportant game against the Vienna Vipers U-14, coach promptly benched Little Luke for the new goalscoring machine, you. You were locked in, scoring a club record five goals while pathetic Jack went goalless. You even debuted your signature celebration, the “drunk driver,” which consisted of drinking heavily from a water bottle in one hand while turning an imaginary steering wheel frantically with the other. Unfortunately, Hannah wasn’t there to watch you destroy Jack. Rumour had it that she was sick. Also, your team won the game 6-5, with your brother making three costly mistakes.  
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
  The eighth game, the regular season closer, was more important. And although coach had lost his faith in your brother at this point, you successfully convinced him give your brother one last chance. You needed this game: Hannah was bound to return from whatever fever she had—no one can be sick for more than a week realistically—and just imagine Jack’s temper tantrum as he grovels at your feet when he doesn’t get that one stupid point-blank goal. Long story short, your team lost to the Springfield Sprites 6-7 and subsequently came second in the league standings. Although you scored a record-extending six goals, your brother let in five goals before getting substituted for a random bench player who let in the last two goals. Unfortunately, Hannah wasn’t there again, and you were starting to wonder if it was a conspiracy by that sly guy Jack. The parents got sick of your celebration as well. And coach was furious. 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
  That night, your brother cried up a storm after because of his performances. He accused you of not properly training him and made your parents beg you for an apology regarding a misrepresentation of the goalie: 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">“I said I was a really good goalie but that didn’t mean it was easy!” </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">“Just go apologise to your brother. We beg you…” </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
  He was an easy boy to please. It only took you an hour of video games before he was cooking up a plan to impress his next crush.  
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
  In the postseason tournament, you returned to your duties as a goalie after your coach nagged you to, and Hannah returned to be Jack’s number one supporter, completely oblivious to his shortcomings. The team won the championship thanks to your heroic saves and the outstanding midfield, but in typical Jack fashion, he stole the spotlight in the final with a lucky point-blank goal that appeared at his dainty feet after bouncy of Little Luke’s fat red nose. During the trophy celebration, he even got to hoist the trophy high above his head while you stood to the side. 
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 0pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">
  After that year, Hannah’s family moved to the big city and Jack might or might not had quit playing soccer because of that. You moved to playing striker permanently when coach found another goalie who was decent enough to fill your cleats. But there was no one to impress anymore and you had to actually play the sport for the love of it.
