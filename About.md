Hi! I'm Bao.

I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Virginia! Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of technology and social impact, particularly in how to leverage data in addressing real-world challenges.

I sometimes write for my classes. I love random knowledge and trivia, especially Quiz Bowl. I am also a hobby photographer, getting lucky with most of my photos.
